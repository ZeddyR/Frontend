		<p>Hello!		
		</p>	
		<p>I'm Zayd, and welcome to my portfolio. This website was created to document my work and journey to becoming an AWS Cloud Architect.</p>
		<p>I have spent 7 years working in the IT sector as a Sales executive, delivering Account Management and Business Development. 
		</p>
		<p>My experiences in the IT channel along with a passion for technology has allowed me to form strong working relationships with customers from different backgrounds and at all levels. I have specifically worked with clients in Managed Service Providers, IT resellers and System Integrators.  
		</p>
		<p>In the last 3 years I have worked for a Cyber security distributor where I was with learning and understanding a wide range of products that fall under security. Security is one of my key area's of strength and thus aim to specialise in this going forward. 
		</p>

		<h2>WHY AWS?</h2>
		<div id="timeline"></div> <!-- Placeholder for timeline entries -->
		
		<p>I made the decision to pivot my career to AWS cloud technology for several key reasons. My ambition is to further my position in technology and move more into a project based role where I can utilise my teamwork & collaboration skills. Working with customers will always be important, I now want to build on this by helping solve real world challenges, simplify operations and deploy resources using the easiest methods. I believe I can use my experience in the IT sector to an advantage and leverage my knowledge with Cyber security & On-prem infrastructure, so I can transition into a role within Cloud. 
		</p>

		<p>Currently I am enrolled with Optima IT - a reputable AWS academy. I have successfully obtained AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architect Associate, the latter of which covers many scenario based questions to solve customer challenges. Participating in study groups allowed me to share and gain knowledge efficiently whilst also helping other students. To help with automation and replication, I am preparing myself for the Terraform Associate certification. With 2 years of hand-on experience with AWS, my progress has been promising as I gain higher interest and curiosity. I have completed a number of lab exercises on AWS Skill builder and completed a few personal cloud projects, which enabled me to gain skills and hand-on experience with AWS technologies. See in the menu a list of personal projects I have completed with AWS.
